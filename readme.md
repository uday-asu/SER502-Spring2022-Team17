# To run this project follow below step 1-6:
1) Check if you have installed JAVA with version 1.8 on your system.
2) To clone the project on to your system use the below command:
   *git clone https://github.com/uday-asu/SER502-Spring2022-Team17.git/*
3) Import the cloned project into your preferred IDE and make sure that you have SER502Project_team17_SPL.jar in lib
   folder.
4) Now open command prompt to run the JAR file mentioned in step-3.
5) To execute any of the sample programs that are in Sample folder use the below command:
   *java -jar /path/to/SER502Project_team17_SPL/lib/SER502Project_team17_SPL.jar /path/to/SER502Project_team17_SPL/samples/filename.spl*

# Future Implementations
1) As of now our language does the basic works like declarations, mathematical operations, branch statements etc,
2) In the future we would like to implement file parsing and csv record reading. 
3) We would like to incorporate the usage of libraries for our language too. 
4) We see scope and potential in our languages to harness machine learning too.
